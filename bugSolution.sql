To mitigate this, use `TRY...CATCH` blocks (or equivalent error handling mechanisms depending on your specific SQL dialect) to gracefully handle these situations.  Here's an example showing how to handle potential errors:

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO users (id, username) VALUES (1, 'testuser');
    INSERT INTO users (id, username) VALUES (1, 'anotheruser'); --This will throw an error
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    -- Handle the error
    SELECT ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber, ERROR_SEVERITY() AS ErrorSeverity, ERROR_STATE() AS ErrorState, ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS ErrorProcedure, ERROR_LINE() AS ErrorLine, ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;
    -- Log the error, or rollback transaction, etc.
END CATCH; 
```

This improved version attempts the inserts. If an error occurs, the `CATCH` block executes, allowing you to handle the error appropriately, preventing unexpected database state changes.  Always include robust error handling in your SQL code to ensure data integrity and application stability.
