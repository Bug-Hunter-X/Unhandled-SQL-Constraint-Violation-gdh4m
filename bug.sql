In SQL, a common oversight is neglecting to handle potential errors during database operations.  For example, inserting a record that violates a unique constraint or attempting to update a non-existent row can lead to unexpected behavior.  A simple query like this could cause issues:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, username) VALUES (1, 'testuser');
INSERT INTO users (id, username) VALUES (1, 'anotheruser');
```

The second insert will fail because the `id` column is presumably a primary key or has a unique constraint, however, the error may not be explicitly handled leading to partial success and data inconsistency.
